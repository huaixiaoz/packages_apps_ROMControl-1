ROM Control is property of Android Open Kang Project(AOKP)\Team Kang and i take no credit for its creation, all credits go to Romann and AOKP for its creation. I am in no way part of AOKP\Team Kang, but i do thank them for givng me permission to integrate RC into my rom.

This repo is here to show what i've changed in ROM Control for Genesis. The original ROMControl repo from AOKP is here:
